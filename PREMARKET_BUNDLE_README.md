- Custom date range analysis

## 🚀 Integration with Main Dashboard

### Automatic Mode Switching
The main dashboard (`indian_stock_market_dashboard_main.py`) automatically detects market sessions:

- **Market Closed:** Shows "🌅 Pre-Market Analysis" tab
- **Market Open:** Shows "📈 High Volume Stocks" tab (live data)
- **Pre-Market Session (9:00-9:15 AM):** Shows pre-market analysis with active session indicator

### Sidebar Integration
- Pre-market quick view in sidebar
- Session status indicators
- Quick access to full pre-market analysis

## 📊 Pre-Market Scoring System

### Scoring Algorithm (0-100 scale)
```
Pre-Market Score = Volume Score (40%) + Price Movement Score (30%) + Volatility Score (30%)
```

**Volume Score (0-40 points):**
- Very High Volume (50L+): 40 points
- High Volume (10L+): 30 points  
- Medium Volume (75K+): 20 points
- Low Volume: 10 points

**Price Movement Score (0-30 points):**
- 5%+ movement: 30 points
- 3-5% movement: 25 points
- 1-3% movement: 15 points
- <1% movement: 5 points

**Volatility Score (0-30 points):**
- 8%+ volatility: 30 points
- 5-8% volatility: 25 points
- 3-5% volatility: 15 points
- <3% volatility: 5 points

### Score Interpretation
- **80-100:** Very High Priority - Monitor closely
- **60-79:** High Priority - Good pre-market focus
- **40-59:** Medium Priority - Secondary consideration
- **0-39:** Low Priority - Consider other options
